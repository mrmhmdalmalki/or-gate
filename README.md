# OR Gate

An OR gate outputs `1` **when at least one input is `1`** (`Y = A + B`).

It is built the simplest way — a **NOR gate followed by a NOT gate** — so there is nothing new
to build at the transistor level. Both sub-gates already exist in this project: the
[`nor`](https://github.com/mrmhmdalmalki/nor-gate) board and the
[`not`](https://github.com/mrmhmdalmalki/not-gate) board.

### Truth table

| `A` | `B` | `Y` |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

`Y = A + B`

## How it is built

> OR = NOT( NOR(A, B) ) = A + B

A NOR gate gives `NOT(A+B)`; inverting it with a NOT gate gives `A+B`. Both stages use the
complementary (2N3904 + 2N3906) design, so the output is driven to a clean, strong
`~4.8 V` / `~0.2 V`.

## Building it on a breadboard

This gate has **no transistors of its own**; it is a finished **NOR board** whose output feeds
a finished **NOT board**:

| Block | Build guide | Input | Its output goes to |
|:------|:------------|:------|:-------------------|
| **NOR board** | [nor-gate](https://github.com/mrmhmdalmalki/nor-gate) | Inputs `A`, `B` | the input of the NOT board (this node is `‾A+B`) |
| **NOT board** | [not-gate](https://github.com/mrmhmdalmalki/not-gate) | `‾A+B` | Output `Y = A + B` |

Both boards share the **same +5 V rail and the same GND**. `+5 V` and `GND` are **nodes**, not
physical positions.

Quick test: Output is +5 V when at least one input is +5 V.

## Components

An OR gate is a NOR gate plus a NOT gate, each already documented (and built from transistors)
in this project:

| Block | Folder | Transistors |
|:------|:-------|:-----------:|
| NOR | [`nor-gate`](https://github.com/mrmhmdalmalki/nor-gate) | 2 × 2N3904 + 2 × 2N3906 |
| NOT | [`not-gate`](https://github.com/mrmhmdalmalki/not-gate) | 1 × 2N3904 + 1 × 2N3906 |

**Total: 3 × 2N3904 + 3 × 2N3906**, plus each board's base resistors (10 kΩ), LED resistors
(220 Ω) and indicator LEDs. See the individual folders for the exact per-board wiring.

### Power

- One shared **+5 V** rail and a common **GND** for both boards.
